# Architecture

This project is primarily a collection of Python scripts designed for learning and demonstrating fundamental programming concepts. It also includes a few utility scripts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a flat structure with most scripts in the root directory.

### Core Learning Scripts

These scripts form a progressive tutorial on Python programming:

*   **`02.第一个Python程序.py`**: Introduces the basic "Hello, World!" program.
*   **`03.Python语言中的变量.py`**: Covers variable declaration, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), and type casting.
*   **`04.Python语言中的运算符.py`**: Demonstrates arithmetic and logical operators.
*   **`05.分支结构.py`**: Explains `if-else` conditional statements.
*   **`06.循环结构.py`**: Covers `for` and `while` loops.
*   **`07.分支和循环结构实战.py`**: Provides practical examples combining branches and loops, such as finding prime numbers and generating Fibonacci series.
*   **`08.常用数据结构之列表-1.py`**: Introduces the list data structure and its basic operations.
*   **`09.常用数据结构之列表-2.py`**: More advanced list operations and examples, including a "Double Chromosphere" lottery number generator.
*   **`10.常用数据结构之元组.py`**: Explains the tuple data structure.
*   **`11.常用数据结构之字符串.py`**: Covers string manipulation.

### Utility Scripts

*   **`augment_code.py`**: Implements the OAuth 2.0 PKCE authorization flow for a VSCode extension. This is a standalone utility for authentication.
*   **`get_ip.py`**: A script to retrieve the local and public IP addresses of the machine.

### Testing

*   **`test1/` and `test2/`**: These directories contain empty scripts and appear to be for testing purposes.

## Execution

Most of the scripts are self-contained and can be executed directly from the command line (e.g., `python 02.第一个Python程序.py`). The learning scripts often contain commented-out code and examples that can be uncommented for execution.
